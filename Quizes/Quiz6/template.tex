\begin{exercise}{Question \# 1}
\end{exercise}
\noindent
While it does not make much sense to apply this to the game I am making for this class, I am
making a steganography application for my security class project which is easier to apply this to.
I could add tutorial and learning section to the application that teaches people about what it does
and how it does it, along with information on stenography and cryptography, in general, that could
help some people learn about cybersecurity. If the application was going out to the public, it could
definitely help foster learning for its users.


\begin{exercise}{Question \# 2}
\end{exercise}
\noindent
I do believe that it is possible to make a hacker's code of ethics that does not engage in 
moral relativism. Moral Relativism states that "moral judgments are true or false only relative
to some particular standpoint." And it is possible to establish ethics that are not necessarily
specific to the technological world. For example, a rule such as "Never instigate" would apply well 
to the hacker world, while it is also an ethic that is not relative to the hacker world and can be 
applied to anything.

\begin{exercise}{Question \# 3}
\end{exercise}
\noindent
Cyberterrorism is the act of commiting terrorism within "cyberspace", i.e. over the internet
or on local computer networks. Terrorism in this sense is some action meant to harm or inspire
fear again some group of people, such as a company or government, for some type of gain (usually political). 
One example of this would be to hack into some critical infrastructure, such as a powerplant, and take 
control of it. 
\newline 

\begin{exercise}{Question \# 4}
\end{exercise}
\noindent
Cybersecurity issues and technological privacy issues connected in many ways. The more data
companies collect, the more data that hackers could steal. The less privacy we have on the internet
the more vulnerable we are to lose important information to hackers.
