\section{Biography}

My name is Andrew Player and this is a little about myself. I am a Junior studying Computer Science 
and Mathematics. Originally, I am from Illinois, near Chicago, but now
 I live in a dry cabin in Fairbanks. My favorite things to do are playing
 video games and hiking.

\newline
There are a few things that I would like to learn in this class. One thing
that I would like to learn is how computer ethics have and are influincing 
actual policy. Another thing is how computer ethics has influenced the ethics
of companies. I would also like to learn about the process by which we determine
what software is ethical and what isn't in an objective way. \cite[100]{lipsum}
